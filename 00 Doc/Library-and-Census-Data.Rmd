## Summary of Subsets of Library Data
<a href="#top">Back To Top</a>

This data is a subset of the library data that was re-configured to make Digital Cost, Other Cost, Print Cost, and Total Cost to be a subset of a larger category -- Collection Cost Type. This way, the data could be easily grouped on the same visualization.

```{r states_boxplot}
summary(states_boxplot)
```

This data is a subset of the library data that was re-configured to make Children's Programs, Young Adult Programs, and Adult Programs to be a subset of a larger category -- Program Type. This way, the data could be easily grouped on the same visualization.

```{r Program_Category}
summary(Program_Category)
```
